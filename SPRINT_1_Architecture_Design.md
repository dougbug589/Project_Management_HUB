# Sprint 1: Architecture and UI Design

Date: January 9, 2026
Goal: Architecture and UI design (wireframes and navigation)
Status: Completed

## 1. Sprint Overview
Sprint 1 formalized the architecture and user interface foundation. The focus was on establishing structure, navigation, and reusable components so feature development could proceed consistently and quickly in later sprints.

## 2. Objectives
- Define application architecture for frontend, backend, and data access
- Establish routing conventions under the App Router
- Create foundational layout and navigation components
- Define a reusable UI component library
- Confirm module-level API organization for scalability

## 3. Scope
In Scope
- Application routing and layout structure
- Reusable UI components and styling conventions
- Navigation hierarchy and screen organization
- Initial module boundaries for API routes

Out of Scope
